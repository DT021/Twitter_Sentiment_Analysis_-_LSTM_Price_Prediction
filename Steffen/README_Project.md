## **Introduction** 

In this project our main aim is to develop a machine learning backed dashboard that provides insights in (future) stock prices.

This is done two different and complimentary ways:

1) We designed, developed, trained and tested along short-term memory (LSTM) model and a linear regression model. Those models enable us to make predicitions on future stock prices based on historical data.

2) We designed, developed, trained and tested a recurrent neural network (RNN) specifically focused on sentiment analysis of tweets on Twitter. This model is uniquely equipped to determine the sentiment of tweets that are talking about individual stocks and classifies the core message as either 'positive' or 'negative'.

Those two approached care combined in a comprehensive dashboard that gives any investor, from individual to big corporation, a powerful tool to predict developments in the stock market.

## **Postmortem**

It should not come as a surprise: predicting stock prices based on historic data and sentiment analysis is not an easy objective. During our research project, we ran into several challenges both in terms of design, model development and data (analysis). These challenges provided us with valuable insights as to where future work could be done.
