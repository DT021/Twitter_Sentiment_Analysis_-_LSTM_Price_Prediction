## **Introduction** 

We developed a Deep Neural Network advisory platform that provides price signals and live proprietary financial Twitter senitments for equity trading.

We also compared it with the standard regression model
This is done two different and complimentary ways:

1) We designed, developed, trained and tested a long short-term memory (LSTM) model and a linear regression model. Those models enable us to make predicitions on future stock prices based on historical data.

2) We designed, developed, trained and tested a long short-term memory (LSTM) model  specifically focused on sentiment analysis of tweets on Twitter. This model is uniquely equipped to determine the sentiment of tweets that are talking about individual stocks and classifies the core message as either 'positive' or 'negative'.

These two approaches are combined in a comprehensive dashboard that gives any investor, from individual to big corporation, a powerful tool to predict developments in the stock market.

### *Data and challenges we ran into during the exploration and clean up process*

For the first part of the project we used historical stock data provided to us by the Alpaca (?) API. We randomly selected six different stocks (MSFT, AMD, TSLA, JNJ, REGN, GILD). 




## **Data Analysis: Findings** 

Below we will zoom in on the three model that we used in this project. 


### **Model 1: Predicting stock prices using sklearn linear regression**




### **Model 2: Predicitng stock prices LSTM using Tensorflow/Keras**

evaluation and training of models

### **Model 3: Twitter sentiment analysis LSTM using Tensorflow/Keras/NLTK**

- Tweepy / Twitter API
- Hand coding tweets / difficulties training the model
- integrating it into dashboard


## ** Discussion of Findings **

Conclusions - introduce dashboard? / link or screenshot to dashboard

## **Postmortem**

It should not come as a surprise: predicting stock prices based on historic data and sentiment analysis is not an easy objective. During our research project, we ran into several challenges both in terms of design, model development and data (analysis). These challenges provided us with valuable insights as to where future work could be done.
